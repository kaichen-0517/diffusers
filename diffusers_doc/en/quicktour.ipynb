        "Diffusion models are trained to denoise random Gaussian noise step-by-step to generate a sample of interest, such as an image or audio. This has sparked a tremendous amount of interest in generative AI, and you have probably seen examples of diffusion generated images on the internet. 🧨 Diffusers is a library aimed at making diffusion models widely accessible to everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're a developer or an everyday user, this quicktour will introduce you to 🧨 Diffusers and help you get up and generating quickly! There are three main components of the library to know about:\n",

        "* The [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) is a high-level end-to-end class designed to rapidly generate samples from pretrained diffusion models for inference.\n",
        "* Popular pretrained [model](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/./api/models) architectures and modules that can be used as building blocks for creating diffusion systems.\n",
        "* Many different [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/./api/schedulers/overview) - algorithms that control how noise is added for training, and how to generate denoised images during inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The quicktour will show you how to use the [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) for inference, and then walk you through how to combine a model and scheduler to replicate what's happening inside the [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline).\n",
